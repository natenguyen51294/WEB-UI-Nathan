      <h3>Pixie Cut</h3>
      <p>A pixie cut is a short hairstyle generally short on the back and sides of the head and slightly longer on the
        top and very short bangs. It is a variant of a crop. The name is derived from the mythological Pixie, though the
        actual hairstyle was popularized by Disney's Fairies Franchise, especially Tinker Bell.</p>

      <h3>French Braids</h3>
      <p>A French braid also called French plait and Tresse Africaine is a type of braided hairstyle. The French braid
        is a hairstyle that originated in North Africa and later adopted in France. The misnomer "French" may possibly
        be traced back to an 1871 short story from Arthur's Home Magazine.</p>

      <h3>Short and Straight</h3>
      <p>Short hair exudes boldness, confidence, individuality and style. Straight hair is very modern-looking, chic,
        clean and neat. It shows off the architecture of the haircut, hiding nothing. Combined, this kind of haircut
        speaks beauty and power.</p>

      <h3>Red Hair</h3>
      <p>Red is the color of extremes. It's the color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and
        adventure. Red has been known for the color of fire and blood and most of red's symbolism today arises from its
        powerful associations in the past</p>

        hair. Are you brave enough to be willing to take a risk? Or maybe just try on something new that nobody else has
        the gut to do so.
